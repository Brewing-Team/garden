In this series we build a physically based renderer for a dynamic voxel world. From ‘Whitted-style’ ray tracing with shadows, glass and mirrors, we go all the way to ‘unbiased path tracing’ – and beyond, exploring advanced topics such as reprojection, denoising and blue noise. The accompanying source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/jbikker/voxpopuli) and is written in easy-to-read ‘sane C++’.

This series consists of nine articles. Contents: *(tentative until finalized)*

## In This Article…

In the last article we enabled some complex rendering features for the ray tracer using random sampling and accumulation over time. This yields pretty images, except when the camera is moving. It’s not going to be easy to get rid of this noise entirely, but there are a lot of things we can do to improve the situation. We start at the basis: The random numbers we use to generate samples.

Warning: This is a somewhat theoretical episode.

## Starting Point

For this episode we will need a simple scene and some noise. A suitable scene can be constructed by replacing `Scene::Scene()` in `scene.cpp` by:

| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 | Scene::Scene ()  {  {  }  } |
| --- | --- |

This produces a floor and four pillars. Next, we render the scene with an area light and some basic shading, using the following minimalistic `Renderer::Trace` function:

| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 | float3 Renderer::Trace (Ray & ray,int depth,int x,int y)  {  scene.FindNearest (ray);  if (ray.voxel \== 0) return float3 (0.4f,0.5f,1.0f);  float3 P ((RandomFloat () + 1) / 2,(RandomFloat () + 6) / 5,3);  float3 I \= ray.IntersectionPoint (),L \= normalize (P \- I);  if (scene.IsOccluded (Ray (I,L,10))) return 0.2f;  return 2 \* max (0.2f,dot (ray.GetNormal (),L));  } |
| --- | --- |

This should produce the following output. It should run in real-time; if it instead looks like a slide show, you may be running a Debug build. Select ‘Release’ to resolve this.

Figure 1: Soft shadows using white noise.

And that’s where this article begins.

## Stratification

The noise in the *[penumbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra#Penumbra)* of the soft shadows of the pillars has a name: It’s *[white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)*. We obtain it by using a proper pseudo-random number generator: ‘Pseudo’, because that’s the best a computer can do. The RNG used in the template is a fast but good one: Marsaglia’s [Xor32](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v008i14) algorithm. You can find its implementation in `tmpl8math.cpp`. Each time we call `RandomFloat` we get a number between 0 and 1. The random number is *uniform*, which means that every value between 0 and 1 should have the same probability of being generated. If we use this RNG to produce 100 x-coordinates and 50 y-coordinates, we get this image:

![](https://jacco.ompf2.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xor32.png)

Figure 2: White noise distribution.

The RNG has a problem. Quite often, two or more white dots are right next to each other. In fact, some of them are in the same position. To make matters worse, some parts of the picture have rather few dots. The same pattern, clusters and all, appears in the noisy penumbra of the soft shadow.

An easy way to improve matters is a technique called *stratification.* It works like this: We calculate 100 random dots, but instead of giving each dot the full rectangle to pick a spot on, we limit each to a *stratum*:

![](https://jacco.ompf2.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/strata.png)

Figure 3: Stratification with 10×10 strata.

Here, the rectangle is divided in 100 equal *strata*, and each *stratum* receives one random dot. The effect is interesting: Each location in the full rectangle still has a chance of being covered by a dot, but the dots are now much better distributed.

We can use this technique to improve the shadow. Change the call to Trace inside `Renderer::Tick()` to:

| 1 | float3 pixel \= Trace (r,0,x,y); |
| --- | --- |

This tells `Trace` what the pixel coordinate is for the ray we’re tracing; we need that info inside `Renderer::Trace` to determine the stratum. Inside `Renderer::Trace()`, change the single line that picks a random point `P` on the light. It reads:

| 1 | float3 P ((RandomFloat () + 1) / 2,(RandomFloat () + 1) / 5,3); |
| --- | --- |

Modify it to:

| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7 | float r0 \= RandomFloat (),r1 \= RandomFloat ();  if (x \> SCRWIDTH / 2)  {  if (x & 1) r0 \*= 0.5f;else r0 \= (r0 + 1) \* 0.5f;  if (y & 1) r1 \*= 0.5f;else r1 \= (r1 + 1) \* 0.5f;  }  float3 P ((r0 + 1) / 2,(r1 + 6) / 5,3); |
| --- | --- |

For the left side of the screen this changes nothing, so we have something to compare to. For the right half of the screen however, groups of 2×2 pixels become strata: The top-left pixel of the group will use random numbers for x and y in the range 0.. 0.5, while the bottom-right pixel uses random numbers in the range 0.5.. 1. This works… Sort of:

![](https://jacco.ompf2.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/badstrata-1024x472.png)

Figure 4: One sample per pixel. Left: White noise. Right: Stratification over 2×2 pixels, resulting in patterns due to correlation.

When you think about it, it makes sense. For each pixel in a 2×2 pixel group, each pixel will *always* sample the *same* quadrant of the area light. The pixel next to it will *always* sample a different quadrant. If one quadrant is fully visible, while the other isn’t, we get patterns: There is now a *correlation* between the position of a pixel, and the random numbers generated for it.

The solution is simple. If we sample each stratum for each pixel, we no longer skip quadrants, but we do keep the benefits of stratification. In this case we have four strata, so we take four samples in `Renderer::Tick()`:

| 1  2  3 | float3 pixel \= 0.25f \*  (Trace (r,0,x + 1,y + 1) + Trace (r,0,x,y) +  Trace (r,0,x + 1,y) + Trace (r,0,x,y + 1)); |
| --- | --- |

The result:

Figure 5: Four samples per pixel. Left: White noise. Right: Stratification with four strata.

It is quite clear that even with four strata the result is much better than just white noise. More strata will be even better – with diminishing returns, though. Sadly, there is a drawback to stratification: For $N$ strata, we need to take $N$ samples for each pixels to avoid correlation, and that will quickly reduce the ray tracer to a slideshow…

Luckily, there is a way to get the benefits of stratification even with a single sample per pixel.

## Blue Noise

Stratification for an area light works because it ensures that four samples actually sample all four quadrants of the area light. But, we can do even better. How about this distribution of samples over the surface of the light source:

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Poisson_disk_sampling.svg/1024px-Poisson_disk_sampling.svg.png)

Figure 6: Poisson disk blue noise. Source: Wikipedia.

This is *blue noise*, where each sample has a minimum distance to other samples. This beats even the 10×10 strata we saw earlier. Problem is: How do we generate the positions of these samples? The answer is: We don’t; we use pre-calculated values. Have a look at this texture, which is generously provided by Christoph Peters on his [Moments in Graphics](https://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html) blog:

![](https://jacco.ompf2.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LDR_RG01_0-1.png)

Figure 7: Precalculated blue noise. Source: Christoph Peters / Moments in Graphics.

In this texture the red and green channels are used to store the precalculated blue noise. Image data is generally integer data, but if we extract red and green and divide by 256, we get numbers in the range 0..1, which we can then use as random numbers.

Let’s put that to the test. For this, we tile the texture over the screen, and use the values in red and green as our ‘random numbers’.

First, undo the last change to `Tick`, so pixels once again use a single sample:

| 1 | float3 pixel \= Trace (r,0,x,y); |
| --- | --- |

After that, the modifications in `Renderer::Trace()` are modest.

| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 | static Surface blue ("assets/LDR\_RG01\_0.png");  float r0 \= RandomFloat (),r1 \= RandomFloat ();  if (x \> SCRWIDTH / 2)  {  int pixel \= blue.pixels \[(x & 63) + (y & 63) \* 64\];  int red \= pixel \>> 16,green \= (pixel \>> 8) & 255;  r0 \= red / 256.0f;  r1 \= green / 256.0f;  } |
| --- | --- |

The result is staggering.

Figure 8: Sampling an area light using precalculated blue noise.

Blue noise is indeed far better than white noise, and even better than stratification. We will still need to deal with the stationary nature of the blue noise though before we can use it together with the accumulator from the [previous article](https://jacco.ompf2.com/?p=1803).

## Converge

There are several ways to make the blue noise animate over time. We could for instance use multiple blue noise tiles, or shift the tile data. In practice, it turns out that these options are not all that great. More details on that can be found in [Chapter 24](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4842-7185-8_24.pdf) of Ray Tracing Gems II, by NVIDIAs Alan Wolfe, but I am sharing here his conclusion:

To animate blue noise, we just repeatedly add the *golden ratio* to the values. This will yield values outside the range 0..1, so we keep just the fractional part. Like so:

| 1  2 | r0 \= fracf (r0 + frame \* 0.61803399f);  r1 \= fracf (r1 + frame \* 0.61803399f); |
| --- | --- |

We made quite some changes, so here is the full `Renderer::Trace()` function:

| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18 | float3 Renderer::Trace (Ray & ray,int frame,int x,int y)  {  scene.FindNearest (ray);  if (ray.voxel \== 0) return float3 (0.4f,0.5f,1.0f);  static Surface blue ("assets/LDR\_RG01\_0.png");  float r0 \= RandomFloat (),r1 \= RandomFloat ();  if (x \> SCRWIDTH / 2)  {  int pixel \= blue.pixels \[(x & 63) + (y & 63) \* 64\];  int red \= pixel \>> 16,green \= (pixel \>> 8) & 255;  r0 \= fracf (red / 256.0f + frame \* 0.61803399f);  r1 \= fracf (green / 256.0f + frame \* 0.61803399f);  }  float3 P ((r0 + 1) / 2,(r1 + 6) / 5,3);  float3 I \= ray.IntersectionPoint (),L \= normalize (P \- I);  if (scene.IsOccluded (Ray (I,L,10))) return 0.2f;  return 2 \* max (0.2f,dot (ray.GetNormal (),L));  } |
| --- | --- |

This function now requires a ‘frame’ argument, which we provide from `Renderer::Tick()`:

| 1 | float3 pixel \= Trace (r,frame,x,y); |
| --- | --- |

Here, ‘frame’ is a static variable that we increment each frame. It can be placed just before the `#pragma omp parallel for` line:

| 1  2 | static int frame \= 0;  frame ++; |
| --- | --- |

Combined with accumulation (see challenges!), the image now greatly benefits from the blue noise.

Figure 9: Accumulating over time with blue noise samples.

And with that, we reached the end of the fourth episode. Episode 5 will be about accumulating over time when the camera moves. See you next week!

## Challenges

**Challenge 1.** Combine the concepts of this article with those of previous articles in the series to produce a real-time accumulating voxel renderer with colored voxels, glass, mirrors, anti-aliasing, and blue-noise soft shadows, all accumulating to a converged image for a stationary camera.

**Challenge 2.** The sampling problem in this episode is a 2D one: each sample needs two random numbers. Applying blue noise to Fresnel (see episode 2) is a 1D problem, but applying it to a light transport path that involves an area light *and* a single Fresnel event makes the dimensionality of the path 3. Research how to apply blue noise to paths with an even higher dimensionality.
